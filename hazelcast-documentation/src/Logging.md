## Logging Configuration

Hazelcast has a flexible logging configuration and does not depend on any logging framework except JDK logging. It has in-built adaptors for a number of logging frameworks and also supports custom loggers by providing logging interfaces.

To use built-in adaptors, you should set `hazelcast.logging.type` property to one of predefined types below.

-   **jdk**: JDK logging (default)

-   **log4j**: Log4j

-   **slf4j**: Slf4j

-   **none**: disable logging

You can set `hazelcast.logging.type` through XML configuration, API configuration or JVM system property.

-   **XML Configuration**

```xml
<hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config
    http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config/hazelcast-config-3.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

    ....

    <properties>
        <property name="hazelcast.logging.type">jdk</property>
        ....
    </properties>
</hazelcast>
```

-   **API Configuration**

```java
Config cfg = new Config() ;
cfg.setProperty("hazelcast.logging.type", "log4j");
```

-   **System Property**

	-	Using JVM parameter: `java -Dhazelcast.logging.type=slf4j`
	-	Using System class: `System.setProperty("hazelcast.logging.type", "none");`


To use custom logging feature you should implement `com.hazelcast.logging.LoggerFactory` and `com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger` interfaces and set system property `hazelcast.logging.class` as your custom `LoggerFactory` class name.

```java
-Dhazelcast.logging.class=foo.bar.MyLoggingFactory
```

You can also listen to logging events generated by Hazelcast runtime by registering `LogListener`s to `LoggingService`.

```java
LogListener listener = new LogListener() {
    public void log(LogEvent logEvent) {
        // do something
    }
}
LoggingService loggingService = Hazelcast.getLoggingService();
loggingService.addLogListener(Level.INFO, listener):
```
Through the `LoggingService`, you can get the current used ILogger implementation and log your own messages, too.
