### Configuring TCP-IP Cluster

If multicast is not preferred as the way of discovery for your environment, then you can configure Hazelcast for full TCP/IP cluster. As below configuration shows, while `enable` attribute of `multicast` is set to false, `tcp-ip` has to be set to true. For the none-multicast option, all or subset of nodes' hostnames and/or IP addresses must be listed. Note that, all of the cluster members do not have to be listed there but at least one of them has to be active in cluster when a new member joins. The `tcp-ip` tag accepts an attribute called `connection-timeout-seconds` whose default value is 5. Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IPs listed and members cannot properly build up the cluster.

```xml
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <port auto-increment="true">5701</port>
        <join>
            <multicast enabled="false">
                <multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
                <multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
            </multicast>
            <tcp-ip enabled="true">
                <member>machine1</member>
                <member>machine2</member>
                <member>machine3:5799</member>
                <member>192.168.1.0-7</member>
                <member>192.168.1.21</member>
            </tcp-ip>
        </join>
        ...
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
```
